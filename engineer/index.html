    <h4>Name:</h4><p>Chris Freeman
</p>
    <h4>Descriptor:</h4><p>Rocket engineer</p>
    <h4>Quote:</h4><p>“For me, a rocket is only a means--only a method of reaching the depths of space—and not an end in itself… There’s no doubt that it’s very important to have rocket ships since they will help mankind to settle elsewhere in the universe. But what I’m working for is this resettling… The whole idea is to move away from the Earth to settlements in space.”
</p>
    <h4>Who is it:</h4><p>He is 41 years old, he worked as a former rocket scientist in NASA for 10 years
He lives in Houston Texas with his wife and two kids
He graduated from MIT with a degree of physics and did his Phd in Harvard university.</p>
    <h4>What goals:</h4><p>He wanted to help and design personal use rockets to improve private space traveling experience, he is also seeking for flexible working hours and better compensation</p>
    <h4>What attitude:</h4><p>He believes space traveling should not only benefit the nation and for the scientific field, it should also be a unique life experience for space traveling enthusiastic and for someone who can afford space travel like this. He is looking for company that he can work for who has similar believes as him, because he see great opportunity and potential in this field of study.
</p>
    <h4>Which Behavior:</h4><p>He likes to read science scholar articles and conducting researches, he has his own lab and he is still co-writing and publishing papers with other scholars. He is interested in Elon Musk’s SpaceX project, however he is still deciding which company he will apply for. The reason he leaves NASA is that he wanted to focus his research on personal space travel rather than national space projects.</p>
